This is my very simple, un-polished, zombie survival simulator game. Your party (and the main character, James Carregan) are denoted by a red circle. Humans (trustworthy or un-trustworthy, infected or un-infected) are denoted by blue circles. Zombies are denoted by grey circles. The point of the game is to survive as long as possible. 

The game involves meeting survivors who have varying degrees of
 - trustworthiness
 - strength
 - health / resilience
 - immunity to zombie virus

The more people you accept into your party, the more capable of defeating zombies you become. However you also will become more susceptible to being exposed to infected humans should anyone in your party become infected. You will have the option to desert any party members who become infected. 

Any infected party members will, over a short length of time, eventually become a zombie. Any party members which have died, will also eventually become a zombie (re-spawning at the location which they died). This is denoted by the blue circles (previously humans) becoming grey circles (zombies) as time progresses. 

You will need to collect food for your party (the more party members, the more mouths to feed for scarce resources). Traveling gradually decreases health so collecting food is necessary to stay alive. Also fighting zombies (and untrustworthy humans) will also decrease health of your party members. Depending on how you have sorted your party, one particular member will first encounter any enemies. 

You can sort your party by those which need food the most (upon collecting resources they will be first to eat), by the strongest (upon encountering an enemy they will attack, and be attacked, first), by the most immune (upon encountering an enemy this party member will be least susceptible to being infected)

As party members kill more enemies, they will gradually increase their levels which result in stat boosts.

A minimap will be available to show where your party is located as you traverse the area.
